    1000-digit Fibonacci number
    Problem 25

    The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

        Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.

    Hence the first 12 terms will be:

        F1 = 1
        F2 = 1
        F3 = 2
        F4 = 3
        F5 = 5
        F6 = 8
        F7 = 13
        F8 = 21
        F9 = 34
        F10 = 55
        F11 = 89
        F12 = 144

    The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.

    What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
